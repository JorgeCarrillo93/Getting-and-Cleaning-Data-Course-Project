# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Dataset:
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0

Code Book - describes the contents, structure, and layout of a data collection. Contains information intended to be complete and self-explanatory for each variable in a data file

run_analysis.R :
  -Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  -Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  -Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  -Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  -From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
TidyData.txt - Final data set exported to a text file.
